# My first React Native App

This is my first **React Native App**. It was made to acquire knowledge and experience on mobile app development with react native opensource UI software framework. In addition, we have develop in conjunction with **Expo Framework**.


# What does it do?

This app generates **random passwords** and implements **two general usecase**:

> 1. Generate and save the **random password** in local storage;
> 2. Manage passowrds in the local storage.


And then you can save, copy to clipboard and delete a passowrd from local satorage.

# Update

we intend migrating this app to Expo-Router app. Only to improve our knowledge.
